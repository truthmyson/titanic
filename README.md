MODEL TO PREDICT SURVIVORS OF THE TITANIC INCIDENT

Description : This project aims to help predict if a person onboard during the titanic incident survived or not.
I leveraged RandomForest classifier Model to train on the titanic dataset to predict the survival of a person onboard.
I used joblib to save my trained model and pipeline for data cleaning.
I used sklearn cross validation to avoid overfitting in my prediction model.

DATA LOCATION
I had the dataset from kaggle. folloe the link to download the data ; https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data
