MODEL TO PREDICT SURVIVORS OF THE TITANIC INCIDENT

Description : This project aims to help predict if a person onboard during the titanic incident survived or not.
I leveraged RandomForest classifier Model to train on the titanic dataset to predict the survival of a person onboard.
I used joblib to save my trained model and pipeline for data cleaning.
I used sklearn cross validation to avoid overfitting in my prediction model.

TO GET STARTED
1. Clone this repo. run in your preferred directory on your local machine : git clone https://github.com/truthmyson/titanic
2. create a virtual environment. run : python -m venv <virtual_environment_name>
3. Initialize the virtual environment. run : source <virtual_environment_name>/scripts/activate
4. Install the requiremnets in the requirements.txt file. run : pip install -r requirements.txt
